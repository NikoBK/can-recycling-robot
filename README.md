# can-recycling-robot

## About this project
This project was made in 2022, at first semester on AAU Robotics.
The goal for this project was to make a recycling robot with a given robot, the Zumo32U4, by Polulu. For the project each group were given a board,
that resembled a conveyor belt where cans are moved in front of the robot, when the robot is in idle position. Using the built-in proximity sensors the robot will then detect can size and plan a route for movement to sort the can. This is all demonstrated on the video below.

## Programming
This project was programmed in standard C++, using the Arduino IDE compiler.

## Goal of the project
The goal of this project was for all students to get familiarized with a simple robot (The Zumo32U4) that moves in 2 dimensions (horizontally and vertically), while using sensors, encoders & much more.
